# This is Slingshot

Sometimes ur runway is too short so u need a slingshot to takeoff.

And sometimes ur dna is rly difficult to interpret, and you need the highest accuracy possible. Slingshot performs a consensus test of read-fragment duplicates found harboring mutations of interest.

All its takes is 1) a bam with duplicates (not necessarily marked), 2) a list of sites (vcf is okay)
